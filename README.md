# Overview

This is a memory game based on the classic game Simon. There are 6 different colored buttons, and when you press start the current level begins and a random sequence of buttons flash. Users must try to remember and repeat this same sequence by pressing the buttons in order to proceed to the next level. Level 1 has a sequence of 3 buttons, and each subsequent level is 1 button longer. The user has 20 seconds to complete each level, else they automatically fail. The goal of the game is to try to reach the highest level you can. Additionally, players may click and drag any button to any location; this allows users to create personalized layouts if they believe it would help them remember the sequences. I created this game as practice with the Unity game engine.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Git / GitHub
* Unity Game Engine
* C#
* Primarily used the UnityEngine library

# Future Work

* Add sound effects for each button press and a unique sound for completing and failing a level.
* Implement different game difficulties which would determine how many different colors/buttons are on screen and can be used in the randomly generated sequences.
* Implement more customizability options such as allowing users to edit the colors for each button and their border appearance.
